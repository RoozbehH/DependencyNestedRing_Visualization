Data and information visualization have drawn an increasingly wide range of interest from several academic fields and industries. Concurrently, exploring a huge set of data to support
feasible decisions needs an organized method of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The dramatic increasing of data producing during the past decade makes visualization necessary as a
presentation layer on the top of MCDM process. This study aims to propose an integrated strategy to rank the alternatives in the dataset, by combining data, MCDM methods, and visualization layers. In
fact, the well designed combination of Information Visualization and MCDM provides a more userfriendly approach than the traditional methods. We investigate a case study in bibliometric analyses,
which have become an important dimension and tool for evaluating the impact and performance of researchers, departments, and universities. Hence, finding the best and most reliable papers,
authors, and publishers considering diverse criteria is one of the important challenges in science world. Therefore, this text is presenting a new strategy on the bibliometric dataset as a case study
and it demonstrates that this strategy can be more meaningful for the end users than the current tools.<br/>  
Finally, the presented simulations illustrate the performance and utilization of this combination. In other words, the researchers of this study could design and implement a tool that overcomes the
biggest challenges of data analyzing and ranking via a combination of MCDM and visualization methodologies that can provide a tremendous amount of insight and information from a massive
dataset in an efficient way.<br/>
